# NLP Meets ML

This project was part of the classwork at the physical meetings of NTL intiative in Egypt. The project explores sentiment analysis
using NLP and ML and serve as an introduction. The dataset can be found here [link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/review_polarity.tar.gz) and it's also attached as a zip file in this repository.

The code is attached as a jupyternotebook and in case the github does not render the file, a pdf copy of the same code is attached.
